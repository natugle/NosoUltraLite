# NosoUltraLite
This is a very early alfa test version of an ultra lite wallet for the Noso-Project.

NosoUltraLite has been compiled with Lazarus version 2.0.10 and 2.0.12 and testet on PC and Raspberry Pi both 64bit under Linux and under Windows on PC. But expect some bugs and be careful what you do unless you really know what you are doing :-)

Note that the needed libraries are compressed in zip-files and should be extracted into the relevant directories befor compiling.
